Open the SQL editor by navigating to an app and clicking **SQL Query** in the sidebar.

### SQL table, column, and keyword suggestions

The Spice.ai Query Editor will suggest table and column names along with keywords as you type. You can manually prompt for a suggestion by pressing **ctrl+space**.

1. Start typing a SQL command, such as `SELECT * FROM`

2. As you type, the Query Editor will suggest possible completions based on the query context. You can use the arrow keys or mouse to select a completion, and then press **Enter** or **Tab** to insert it into the editor.

Examples of using the SQL suggestions:

* Select the `btc.blocks` table:

  * Type `SELECT * FROM btc` and press Tab. The editor will suggest `btc.blocks` as a possible table. Press Enter to insert it into the query.

2. Write a SQL comment describing your desired query: E.g. `-- Return the Ethereum block number that had the most cumulative gas fees paid from the past hour`

3. Press **Enter** to move the cursor to the next line - this will trigger the auto-completion. It may take a few seconds to generate.

4. Press **Tab** to accept the AI-generated completion.

### Chart Playground (Preview)

Chart Playground is an in-browser charting interface to quickly generate visualizations from queried data, such as **time-series trends, variable relationships, and data distributions**.

1. Click the chart bar icon to access the Chart Playground and view a **recommended chart** upon entry.

2. Use dropdown menus to change x-axis, y-axis, chart style. **Bar, line, dot** chart style are currently supported. Choosing only x or only y will default to a "bar style" distribution plot.

3. **Resize** the chart by dragging the **handles** at the top and right.

4. Download the chart by clicking the **download button** in the top-right corner.

The Chart Playground relies on an [in-browser DuckDB instance](https://uwdata.github.io/mosaic/core/#mosaic-core) with limited capacity. Try to reduce the size of the data if no chart is displayed.

### AI Charting (Preview)

AI Charting is a **conversational** chart interface that offers an **AI-enhanced** experience for visualizing queried data.

By asking a question about queried data, an **interactive chart** will be generated.

1. Click the chat bubble icon to enter the AI Charting interface.

2. Enter a question of the queried data in the input box. **Specify variables and styles** to get most ideal chart result. Hit enter or click submit button to generate the chart.

3. Utilize interactive features including **hovering, zooming, box-select**, etc.

4. If a question entered is not valid for the data, a recommended question will be shown. Click and try the recommended question or ask another question to generate a new chart.

Chart generation may fail if the question requires complex data manipulation or is not relevant to the data, as shown below.
