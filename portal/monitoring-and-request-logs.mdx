Continuously identify and fix issues by tracking process actions with Spice monitoring and request logs.

Under the Monitoring tab, track your app requests, their status codes, and duration, in addition to the existing usage monitoring metrics dashboard.

**Metrics Dashboard**

Track request volume, data usage, and query time at 1 hour, 24 hours, 7 days and 28 days granularity. Start by going to your app and navigating to the Monitoring tab.
