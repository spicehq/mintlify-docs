Welcome to the Spice.ai Cloud Platform documentation!

The **Spice.ai Cloud Platform** is a data and AI application platform; an AI-backend-as-a-service comprising of composable, ready-to-use data and AI building blocks including federated SQL query, machine learning, and cloud-scale, managed [Spice.ai OSS](https://github.com/spiceai/spiceai).

This is the **Spice.ai Cloud Platform** documentation. If you are looking for the **Spice.ai OSS** project documentation please visit [**docs.spiceai.org**](https://docs.spiceai.org).

**Operating data and AI infrastructure can be painful.**

ðŸ˜“ Query data from many sources and backends.

ðŸ˜“ Maintain expensive and often error prone ETL, data, query, and ML infrastructure.

ðŸ˜“ Constantly monitor data, training, and inferencing for errors, correctness, changes, and bottlenecks.

ðŸ˜“ Comply with governance, compliance, and privacy concerns.

**Spice.ai makes it easy.**

With **Spice.ai,** you can:

* Query real-time and historical data **using SQL** in seconds and fetch results in **JSON** or **Apache Arrow** for use with applications, ML, or libraries like **NumPy** and **Pandas**.

* Collaborate on datasets and ML models in one place through the new community-centric developer hub.

* Create, fork, and curate your own hosted datasets and ML models to share and build with the community indexed by the Spice.ai package manager, [spicerack.org](https://spicerack.org).

* Define and manage custom datasets in GitHub along with your application code.

* Bring and federate your own data or leverage 100TB+ of preloaded community data.

Spice.ai is preloaded with community data from ecosystems including **Ethereum**,  **Bitcoin,**&#x61;nd **EigenLayer** along with enriched datasets for NFTs, ENS, Asset Prices, and more. Most datasets are open-source and available at [github.com/spiceai/datasets](https://github.com/spiceai/datasets).

Building blocks available in the Spice.ai platform today include:

* Petabyte-scale Cloud Data Platform

* [Datasets and Views](/building-blocks/datasets-and-views)

* [Spice Firecache](/building-blocks/spice-firecache) (managed Spice.ai OSS)

* [ML Models](/building-blocks/spice-models) (in Preview)

* Community Data including [Blockchain Data](/building-blocks/datasets)
