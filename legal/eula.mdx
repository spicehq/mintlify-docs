Last updated: September 13, 2023

This End User License Agreement (this "Agreement") concerns the Spice AI platform, as described at [spice.ai](https://spice.ai), provided to you by Spice AI, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Company"), as well as related websites, mobile applications, products, and services we may offer to you, including updates, any online services, or downloads associated herewith, the software (including firmware) for any related peripherals, and the associated media, printed materials, and documentation (collectively, “Program”).

You represent to us that you are lawfully able to enter into contracts (e.g., you are not a minor). If you are entering into this Agreement for an entity, such as the company you work for, you represent to us that you have legal authority to access the Program in accordance with this Agreement. By using the Program or “clicking to accept,” you accept the terms of this Agreement with Company. If you do not agree to these terms, you are not permitted to install, copy, or use the Program. To reject these terms, you must not “click to accept” these terms or install, copy, or use the Program.

This Agreement is supplemental to the Spice AI [Website Terms of Use](https://github.com/spicehq/docs/blob/trunk/legal/broken-reference/README.md) and [Privacy Policy](/legal/privacy), which outlines your rights and obligations regarding general website use and privacy considerations, including any user-generated content you and other users may share while using the Program (“**User Content**”). The terms and conditions of the Website Terms of Use and Privacy Policy are incorporated herein by reference and deemed part of this Agreement.

Except for Section 13 (regarding Jurisdiction and Applicable Law), Company reserves the right to modify this Agreement at any time by any means, including without limitation by (1) posting the modifications to [spice.ai](https://spice.ai)/[spice.ai](https://spice.ai) and/or (2) requiring you to “click to accept” the modified Agreement. By continuing to use the Program, you accept any and all modifications to this Agreement. If modifications to the Agreement are unacceptable to you or cause you to no longer be in compliance with this Agreement, you must terminate, and immediately stop using, the Program. If any future modifications are implemented as a “click to accept” Agreement, you may not be able to continue using the Program unless you affirmatively accept the modified Agreement.

**1. Limited Use License.** Subject to and conditional upon your strict compliance with all terms and conditions of this Agreement, Company grants you the non-exclusive, non-transferable, limited license to access and use the Program solely for its intended purpose. All rights not specifically granted are reserved by Company. This Agreement shall also apply to updates to the Program that may be provided to you by the Company, provided that such update may be accompanied by additional terms. You acknowledge and agree that, other than the license granted to you by this Agreement, you shall have no ownership or property interest in any product or service-provided content (as defined below).

**2. License Conditions.** This license is subject to the limitations outlined in this Section. Any use of the Program in violation of these limitations will result in an immediate termination of your license and continued use of the Program will be an infringement of Company's rights in and to the Program.
