Getting started with data science and ML workflow

Built with technologies like [Apache Arrow](/api/sql-query/apache-arrow-flight-api), Spice is designed from the ground-up for data-driven apps, data science and machine learning.

Get started with the following guide.

### 1. Find the data you need

Spice includes a growing set of web3 data, including blockchain data, cryptocurrency and token prices, ENS domains, and more.

Explore the full list of [**datasets**](/building-blocks/datasets) for an overview and see [**SQL Query Tables**](/reference/sql-query-tables) for schemas and details.

### 2. Query datasets using SQL

Querying datasets is as easy as querying data from any SQL database. Try SQL from your browser at [**Spice.ai**](https://spice.ai/).

Reference [**SQL best practices**](https://docs.spice.ai/best-practices) for tips and the best query performance.

### 3. Refer to the SQL reference

Spice uses an [**Apache Calcite**](https://calcite.apache.org) based query engine, which supports **ANSI SQL** with additional SQL **dialect**.

Refer to the [**SQL reference**](/reference/sql-reference) for dialect specific data types, functions, and commands. SQL keywords are also indexed in search for quick lookup.

### 4. Use the Python SDK

Import Spice data in notebooks like Kaggle, Jupyter Notebooks, Google Colab, Anaconda Notebook, etc. with [**3 lines of Python code**](https://docs.spice.ai/sdks/python-sdk#usage).

### 5. Use familiar data science tools and libraries

Easily use Python libraries like **numpy, pandas, pyplot, sklearn, xgboost, and more** to perform **exploratory data analysis (EDA),** create articulate **visualizations**, and build dynamic **machine learning models.**
