# Organizations

Organizations on Spice.ai feature management containers of apps, datasets, users, billing, and settings and let you share these with members of your team.

When you create an account on Spice.ai, a single member organization of the same name as your username is created for you and you are automatically added as a member and the owner of the organization.
