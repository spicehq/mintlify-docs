# External Data Sources

Access and query external data sources in addition to community datasets including the ability to execute SQL joins across both by [creating custom datasets](datasets-and-views.md).

External Data Sources initially supports connecting to [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) with more data sources coming soon.

### Adding an External Data Source

External Data Sources are added and managed through [organizations](../portal/organizations.md) and are available to all Spice applications within the organization. They are private and are not visible or accessible to applications in other organizations.

Navigate to the organization's **Settings** and then the **Data Sources** section.

Once the data source is connected the data source will be made available through its **name**, which will be the schema name for SQL queries. E.g. naming the data source connection "**mydb**" will enable selecting tables with the SQL `SELECT * FROM`` `**`mydb`**`.{table}.`, click the vertical dots to the right of the connection to edit or delete it.

To edit or delete the data source, click the vertical ellipses menu.
