The Ethereum Foundation planned to stop supporting Goerli [one month after Dencun](https://nam12.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fspice.us5.list-manage.com%2Ftrack%2Fclick%3Fu%3De853435dd452a4d343ea1133d%26id%3D1f0eddc002%26e%3D9d81a8fb5f\&data=05%7C02%7Cluke%40spice.ai%7C2ecaa574022c4aac7f8c08dc4833dd51%7C925431232b6a4eec9b6f595720cd1c8f%7C0%7C0%7C638464634819771165%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C\&sdata=6xvJI%2Fdn210TQ7ejvHXrdNTQCH7wkUF2ARQ8JHXCJ1c%3D\&reserved=0) was activated on Ethereum mainnet, which would be April 13th, however nearly all Goerli Validators were already shut down, effectively shutting the network down prematurely. Spice AI is shutting down nodes early, aligned to other providers decisions to also shut down, such as [Alchemy](https://nam12.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fspice.us5.list-manage.com%2Ftrack%2Fclick%3Fu%3De853435dd452a4d343ea1133d%26id%3D351e541bfd%26e%3D9d81a8fb5f\&data=05%7C02%7Cluke%40spice.ai%7C2ecaa574022c4aac7f8c08dc4833dd51%7C925431232b6a4eec9b6f595720cd1c8f%7C0%7C0%7C638464634819780937%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C\&sdata=HAX45r3B5W95bt3JRpQvgoGN1Q7brf4yFHNtdYk4%2BKg%3D\&reserved=0).

After the shutdown, JSON RPC and Beacon requests to **/goerli** returned 404 Not Found and Goerli SQL datasets, while still available for query, are no longer being updated, including Firecache datasets.

[Goerli SQL Tables](https://nam12.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fspice.us5.list-manage.com%2Ftrack%2Fclick%3Fu%3De853435dd452a4d343ea1133d%26id%3D8eb3381cbc%26e%3D9d81a8fb5f\&data=05%7C02%7Cluke%40spice.ai%7C2ecaa574022c4aac7f8c08dc4833dd51%7C925431232b6a4eec9b6f595720cd1c8f%7C0%7C0%7C638464634819763981%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C\&sdata=I%2BdPMW%2FBgLUJXMio7efzCxu3l2R1ju9RLE%2FcvxK0w54%3D\&reserved=0) will remain available for historical query purposes.

### September 2023

In the September release, Crypto/Token Prices data has been significantly expanded and improved upon.

Historical and latest prices are available via REST API and SQL Query.

The number of token pairs supported by the REST API has greatly increased. In addition, if a pair does not have swap data, the platform will attempt to calculate a synthetic price for the pair, routed via swaps across different exchanges. For example, if a price for the pair BAO-AUD does not exist, but the pairs BAO-USDT and USDT-AUD do, then the API will calculate the routed price across the two swaps to determine a synthetic price, which will be returned in the payload as the `spiceai` price. The API will use data cross both centralized and decentralized exchanges. This enables pricing data where it was not possible before.

Additional tables have been added for token prices and assets.

* prices.assets list all assets tracked and available via SQL Query. 8,856 assets are currently available.

* prices.all\_pairs list all the token pairs with prices available via SQL Query. 3,342 pairs are currently available.

In addition to the existing prices.\[tokenA-tokenB] a table of prices for each token pair.

Note: In both cases, the list is a subset of what is available via the REST API.

**New In this Release**

1. \[SQL Query] Added `prices.assets` table.

2. \[SQL Query] Added `prices.all_pairs` table.

3. \[Prices API] Added swap routed token pricing.

4. \[Prices API] Enhanced coverage of token pairs.

5. \[Portal] Bugfixes and minor improvements to the UI.

### August 2023

### April 2023

This month we added new datasets including Chainlink prices data feeds, Aave v2 contract data, Ethereum Shanghai/Capella beacon and withdrawals data, and we now fully index the Goerli testnet. We also released the Goerli Beacon and Ethereum Beacon APIs. **Chainlink Data Feeds:** You can now leverage oracles for various data feed on the Chainlink network by querying prices specific tables including `eth.chainlink.prices` and `eth.chainlink.recent_prices`.

This includes accessing the latest, minute-precision data on `transaction_hash`, `oracle_address`, `block_timestamp`, price of the asset in WEI, `asset_address` and more. The columns and their schema available for each table can be viewed with the describe \<table> command:

```
/* Show the columns available */
DESCRIBE eth.chainlink.prices;
```

Data for for [Curve](https://classic.curve.fi/whitepaper), [Balancer](https://balancer.fi/), [Aave](https://aave.com/), [Yearn](https://yearn.finance/), [DAI](https://makerdao.com/en/), [Tether USD](https://tether.to/en/about-us/) and 30 other top assets is available. See the full list of supported data feeds [here](https://docs.spice.xyz/reference/sql-query-tables/sql-query-tables/chainlink-tables/prices-tables).

**Aave V2 Dataset:** In addition to the Aave token prices data feed on the Chainlink network, we have released indexed Aave V2 data for loans, collaterals and prices. You can query for the latest updates to Aave loans and collateral by querying `eth.aave_v2.loan_updates` and `eth.aave_v2.collateral_updates`.

<Frame caption="Latest view of all Aave V2 loans query, sample output">
  <img src="/images/reference/files%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-x-prod.appspot.com%2Fo%2Fspaces%252F-Mc71sWdWMqp1e_rsTZE-129938315%252Fuploads%252F3j1ccd3MH4e8UxxzTFCC%252FScreen%2520Shot%25202023-05-09%2520at%25209.49.27%2520AM.png" />
</Frame>

**Ethereum Shanghai/Capella Upgrade and Withdrawals Datasets:** The [Ethereum Shanghai/Capella upgrade](https://blog.ethereum.org/2023/03/28/shapella-mainnet-announcement) is now full supported after its completion on April 12, 2023, 10:27:35pm UTC at epoch 194048.

The completion of Ethereum's Shanghai hard fork, also known as "Shapella," has authorized the withdrawal of funds for individuals who have "staked" their ETH to validate and secure blockchain transactions.

We also released the `eth.withdrawals` dataset to capture new withdrawals. For example, you can now query to get ETH withdrawn:

```
with eth_withdrawn as (
  select eth.withdrawals.block_number, SUM(amount) as amount_gwei
  from eth.withdrawals
  group by eth.withdrawals.block_number
  order by block_number asc)

select AVG(amount_gwei / 1e9) as amount_eth
from eth_withdrawn
```

Explore detailed sample SQL queries for DEX, Cross-Chain, Ethereum, [Beacon](/reference/samples-and-examples/example-ethereum-beacon-sql-queries), and [Bitcoin](/reference/samples-and-examples/example-bitcoin-queries) in the Spice Docs.

**Goerli Testnet:** Full support for the Goerli testnet has been added, including hosted beacon and execution nodes, and fully indexed datasets, helping developers test their applications before mainnet launch.

Available with realtime and historical data on [Spice.xyz](https://spice.xyz/), this includes Goerli base type tables, Goerli [token specific tables](https://docs.spice.xyz/reference/sql-query-tables/goerli/token-tables), and Goerli [Beacon Chain specific tables](https://docs.spice.xyz/reference/sql-query-tables/goerli/beacon-chain-tables). You can start by querying `goerli.traces`, `goerli.blocks` or a number of sample beacon queries.

For example, you can query from `goerli.beacon.validators` to retrieve recently updated validators, with their balance and status:

### February 2023

Spice released the NFT dataset with Metadata in preview, along with the Historic Prices API in preview, and the v0.3 update to the Node.js SDK [spice.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@spiceai/spice).

**Historic Prices API (Preview):** In addition to accessing the [Spot Prices](https://docs.spice.xyz/api/prices#spot-prices) of popular token/currency pairs on top exchanges, users can now access the `/v0.1/prices/[pair]` API, which returns historical prices of the specified token/currency pair. You can refine your search by defining parameters like `start` and `end`, which will return all prices between the two timestamps at a provided `granularity`.

Please contact us if you would like to access the API. **NFT Dataset with Metadata (Preview):** You can now query and leverage fungible and non-fungible token contracts under `eth.tokens `as well as isolated NFT specific per token information under `eth.nfts`. These are made available also with name and symbol for ERC721 tokens. See the full list of [NFT tables](https://docs.spice.xyz/reference/sql-query-tables/sql-query-tables/nft-tables) and [Token tables](https://docs.spice.xyz/reference/sql-query-tables/sql-query-tables/token-tables).

**Node.js SDK v0.3:** adds support for improved [Prices APIs](https://docs.spice.xyz/api/prices) supporting spot/latest and historical prices for pair across Coinbase, Gemini, and tracked by Coinmarket Cap. This upgrade ensures the SDK remains the easiest way to use and query [Spice.xyz](https://spice.xyz) with Node.js.

It uses [Apache Apache Flight](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/format/Flight.html) to efficiently stream data to the client and [Apache Arrow](https://arrow.apache.org/) Records as data frames which are then easily converted to JavaScript objects/arrays or JSON.

New functions available on the client are:

* `getPrice()`

* `getPrices()`

You'll need [Node.js 16+](https://nodejs.org/) to get started. See the step-by-step installation guide [here](https://docs.spice.xyz/sdks/node.js-sdk).

#### New In this Release

* \[API] Added [Historic Prices API in Preview](https://docs.spice.xyz/api/prices#historical-prices-preview)

* \[Node.js SDK] [v0.3 release](https://docs.spice.xyz/sdks/node.js-sdk) of Node.js SDK [spice.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@spiceai/spice)

* \[NFT and Metadata] [NFT](https://docs.spice.xyz/reference/sql-query-tables/sql-query-tables/nft-tables) and [Token](https://docs.spice.xyz/reference/sql-query-tables/sql-query-tables/token-tables) datasets in preview

#### Changes

* \[Performance] Improved query performance and scale

* \[Portal] Improved performance of portal pages

* \[Node.js SDK] Add `getPrice` and `getPrices` API

### January 2023

Sharing a packed release this month focused on a new dataset, org management, two developer querying tools, and two SDKs.

**Ethereum Name Service (ENS) Events:** now out of preview, it's available by querying `ens.domains`, which is updated in real-time to have the latest `eth_address`whenever a transfer or name-registered event happens. Both `eth.ens` and other on-demand events indexed under the `eth.ens` prefix such as `eth.ens_event_nameregistered` are updated in real time with the same high-performance standards of published Spice datasets. See the tables [here](https://docs.spice.xyz/reference/sql-query-tables/sql-query-tables/token-tables-1).

**Organization Management:** existing users can start exploring org support and management for users, apps, and datasets by [authorizing Spice with read-only access](https://docs.spice.xyz/get-started/portal-login) when logging into the [Spice.xyz](http://spice.xyz/) portal. This will also act as a parent container for future concepts including apps, users, teams, datasets, and metrics for streamlined management and navigation within [spice.xyz](http://spice.xyz/).

The big game changers this month are [Async Query](https://docs.spice.xyz/api/sql-query-api/http-api-1) and [Flow AI Query Auto-Complete (in preview)](https://medium.com/spice-ai/introducing-spice-ai-flow-8bcfc5cc2294) â€” which supercharge the developer experience.

**Async Query API:** you can post a JSON payload specifying list of query completion, and `notifications` results can be fetched asynchronously once the query has completed. Choose function client apps such as AWS Lambda to async query Spice.xyz and receive result notifications by webhook. Results are accessible up to 20 minutes after they are posted.

**Flow (AI SQL Query Auto-Complete):** you can now query with plain text, hit enter, and watch as Flow autocompletes the request with the corresponding SQL lines in your [spice.xyz](http://spice.xyz/) query editor. Hit tab to accept the AI-generated completion, then accept, reject, or edit before run the query.

We've also released the new [gospice Golang SDK](https://docs.spice.xyz/sdks/go) and added improvements to our [Python SDK](https://docs.spice.xyz/sdks/python-sdk) including timeout support.

**Go SDK:** gospice is the easiest way to query [Spice.xyz](https://spice.xyz/) from Go. It uses [Apache Apache Flight](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/format/Flight.html) to efficiently stream data to the client and [Apache Arrow](https://arrow.apache.org/) Records as data frames. GoDocs available at [pkg.go.dev/github.com/spiceai/gospice](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/spiceai/gospice).

We continue to make performance improvements for faster, more reliable queries and also recently launched our much anticipated Polygon Support, which you can read more about [here](https://blog.spice.ai/build-multi-chain-with-spice-ai-now-with-polygon-support-9db156f36d80).

### May 2022

Spice now has some of the best automated token standard detection for erc20, erc721, and erc1155 tokens available. Tokens are detected by their signatures and as they emit events over time, so Spice provides a probability of standards compliance to each contract. Along with this support are now token-specific tables like `eth.tokens_erc1155` and `eth.token_transfers_erc20`. See the entire list [Tokens Tables](/reference/sql-query-tables/ethereum/token-tables).

Performance is now even better, especially for larger queries, and for results over the HTTP API. We still recommend the [Apache Arrow Flight API](/api/sql-query/apache-arrow-flight-api) that's easily accessible via the [Python SDK](/sdks/python-sdk) for production use though.

WebSocket support is now available in private preview to Design Partners - get in touch if you are interested in custom limits, early access features, and dedicated support.
