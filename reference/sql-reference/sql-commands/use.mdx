The `USE` command enables you to specify the context to be used for the current query session. After you issue this command, your queries do not need to specify the path of the tables and views that they run against. When you want to query tables and views in a different path, you can run this command again with that path or add the path to your queries.

### Syntax

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash USE Example
  USE <path> 
  ```
</CodeGroup>

#### Parameter

* \<path> `String` The path that of the tables, views, or both that you want to query.

**Example**

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash Use the demo source.
  USE eth.recent_blocks 
  ```
</CodeGroup>
