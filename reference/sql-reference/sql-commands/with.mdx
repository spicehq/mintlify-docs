title: "WITH"
---

1. [ðŸ“šREFERENCE](/reference)
2. [SQL Reference](/reference/sql-reference)
3. [SQL Commands](/reference/sql-reference/sql-commands)

The `WITH` clause defines a common table expression (CTE), which is a temporary named result set. The definition of a CTE includes its name, an optional list of column names, and a query expression (that is, a `SELECT` statement).

For more information about `SELECT` statements, see [SELECT](/reference/sql-reference/sql-commands/select).

### Syntax

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash Example
  [ WITH <cte_name> [ ( <cte_column1>, <cte_column2>, ... ) ]
      AS ( <query> ) 
  ]
  SELECT ...
  ```
</CodeGroup>

### Parameters

\[ WITH \<cte\_name> \[ ( \<cte\_column1>, \<cte\_column2>, ... ) ] AS ( \<query> ) ] `String`

A temporary named result set for use in the statement that defines the CTE.

* `<cte_name>`: The name of the CTE you are defining. The CTE must have a unique name within a given query.

* `<cte_column#>`: The names of the columns from the query that defines the CTE.

* `AS <query>`: The query (`SELECT`) statement that defines the CTE.

### Examples

    select eth.withdrawals.block_number, SUM(amount) as amount_gwei
    from eth.withdrawals
