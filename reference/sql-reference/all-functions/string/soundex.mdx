### Syntax

#### SOUNDEX(*expression* varchar) â†’ varchar

* expression: The expression for which a representation of the pronunciation is returned.

**Examples**

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash SOUNDEX example
  SELECT SOUNDEX('Smith'), SOUNDEX('Smythe')
  -- EXPR$0, EXPR$1
  -- S530, S530
  ```
</CodeGroup>

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash SOUNDEX example
  SELECT SOUNDEX('the data lake'), SOUNDEX('the data lakehouse'), SOUNDEX('the data warehouse')
  -- EXPR$0, EXPR$1, EXPR$2
  -- T334, T334, T336
  ```
</CodeGroup>

### Usage Notes

You can use this function to determine whether two strings (for example, similar last names â€˜Smithâ€™ and â€˜Smytheâ€™) have similar pronounciations in the English language. This function uses the [Soundex phonetic algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soundex), which is described in [Soundex System](https://www.archives.gov/research/census/soundex). This function returns only four characters (one letter and three digits). As a result, the output is primarily determined by the first few syllables of the input, rather than the entire string.
