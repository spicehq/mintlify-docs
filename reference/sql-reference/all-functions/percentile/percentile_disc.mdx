Computes a specific percentile for sorted values in a column.

### Syntax

#### PERCENTILE\_DISC(*fraction* double precision) WITHIN GROUP ( ORDER BY *order\_by\_expression* \[ ASC | DESC ] ) â†’ double precision

* fraction: The fraction/percentile value to compute. The value for this must be a numeric literal in the range of 0 to 1 inclusive and represents a percentage.

* order\_by\_expression: The expression to sort and compute the percentile. You can only provide one expression in the ORDER BY clause.

**Examples**

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash PERCENTILE_DISC example
  SELECT PERCENTILE_DISC(0.6) WITHIN GROUP ( ORDER BY pop ASC ), 
  PERCENTILE_DISC(0.6) WITHIN GROUP ( ORDER BY pop DESC )
  FROM eth.recent_blocks 

  -- EXPR$0, EXPR$0
  -- 4520.0, 1806.0
  ```
</CodeGroup>

### Usage Notes

This function computes a specific percentile for sorted values in a column. For each percentile value, `PERCENTILE_DISC` sorts the values using the `ORDER BY` clause. The function then returns the value with the smallest [`CUME_DIST`](/reference/sql-reference/all-functions/window/cume_dist) value given that is greater or equal to the percentile value. For example, `PERCENTILE_DISC (0.5)` computes the 50th percentile (the median) of an expression. The result is equal to a specific column value. This information was originally provided via [Microsoftâ€™s Transact-SQL Reference Guide](https://bit.ly/3BHYHvM).

This function is used with only numeric data types in Spice. `NULL` values in the data set are ignored. However, passing `NULL` as *fraction* or as *order\_by\_expression* will cause an error.
