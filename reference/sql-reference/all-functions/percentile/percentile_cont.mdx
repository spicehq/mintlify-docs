Computes a percentile value based on a continuous distribution of the column input.

### Syntax

#### PERCENTILE\_CONT(*fraction* double precision) WITHIN GROUP ( ORDER BY *order\_by\_expression* numeric \[ ASC | DESC ] ) â†’ double precision

* fraction: The fraction/percentile value to compute. The value for this must be a numeric literal in the range of 0 to 1 inclusive and represents a percentage.

* order\_by\_expression: The expression to sort and compute the percentile. You can only provide one expression in the ORDER BY clause. By default, the sort order is ascending (ASC).

**Examples**

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash PERCENTILE_CONT example
  SELECT PERCENTILE_CONT(0.6) WITHIN GROUP ( ORDER BY pop ASC ),
  PERCENTILE_CONT(0.6) WITHIN GROUP ( ORDER BY pop DESC )
  FROM eth.recent_blocks 

  -- EXPR$0, EXPR$0
  -- 4519.2, 1806.0
  ```
</CodeGroup>

### Usage Notes

This function computes a percentile based on a continuous distribution of the column value. The result is interpolated and may not be equal to any of the actual values in the column. This information was originally provided via [Microsoftâ€™s Transact-SQL Reference Guide](https://bit.ly/3n1NXEz).

This function is used with only numeric data types in Spice. `NULL` values in the data set are ignored. However, passing `NULL` as *fraction* or as *order\_by\_expression* will cause an error.
