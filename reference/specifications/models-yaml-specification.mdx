Spice ML Models YAML manifest Specification v0.2 (beta)

Spice ML Models are defined in YAML. To create a Model, add a manifest YAML file to the `/models` path of a connected [GitHub repository](/portal/apps/connect-github-repository).

### **YAML Schema Reference**

### `name`

The name of the model. Only alpha characters and underscores are supported with no spaces.

### `description`  ****\[optional]

An optional description for the model.

### `family`  ****\[optional]

The model family.

### `type`

The model type. For more details see [Model Type Specification](/reference/specifications/models-yaml-specification/model-type-specification).

### `metadata`

A key-value bag of metadata/parameters for the model. When `type` is `autogluon` or `darts`, `model`, is a reserved key to specify hyperparameters of the underlying model (see [Model Type Specification](/reference/specifications/models-yaml-specification/model-type-specification))

### `handler`

The code file that contains the entry points for training and inferencing.

E.g. `gas_fees.py`

### `epochs`

Training iterations count.

### `training`

**Optional**. Defines training for the model.

**Example**

```
training:
  entry_point: gas_fees.train
  sql: 'WITH counts AS (    SELECT block_number, count(1) as "count" FROM eth.recent_transactions GROUP BY block_number  )  SELECT number as "ts", CAST(b.base_fee_per_gas / 1000000000.0 AS DOUBLE) as "y", CAST(c."count" AS DOUBLE) as "y2"  FROM eth.recent_blocks b  INNER JOIN counts c ON b.number = c.block_number  WHERE b.base_fee_per_gas IS NOT NULL ORDER BY block_number DESC LIMIT 500'
  loggers:
    - tensorboard
```

`entry_point`

The entry point (function) for training.

E.g. `gas_fees.train`

`sql`

The Spice.ai SQL query for fetching training data.

E.g. `WITH counts AS ( SELECT block_number, count(1) as "count" FROM eth.recent_transactions GROUP BY block_number ) SELECT number as "ts", CAST(b.base_fee_per_gas / 1000000000.0 AS DOUBLE) as "y", CAST(c."count" AS DOUBLE) as "y2" FROM eth.recent_blocks b INNER JOIN counts c ON b.number = c.block_number WHERE b.base_fee_per_gas IS NOT NULL ORDER BY block_number DESC LIMIT 500`

#### `loggers`

A list of loggers to enable for each training run.

Supported loggers and their values are:

Logger

Value

[TensorBoard](https://www.tensorflow.org/tensorboard/)

`tensorboard`

***Example***

```
training:
  loggers:
    - tensorboard
```

### `inferencing`

**Optional**. Defines inferencing for the model.

**Example**

```
inferencing:
  entry_point: gas_fees.train
  sql: 'WITH counts AS (    SELECT block_number, count(1) as "count" FROM eth.recent_transactions GROUP BY block_number  )  SELECT number as "ts", CAST(b.base_fee_per_gas / 1000000000.0 AS DOUBLE) as "y", CAST(c."count" AS DOUBLE) as "y2"  FROM eth.recent_blocks b  INNER JOIN counts c ON b.number = c.block_number  WHERE b.base_fee_per_gas IS NOT NULL ORDER BY block_number DESC LIMIT 500'
  lookback_size: 30
  forecast_size: 1
```

`entry_point`

The entry point (function) for inferencing.

E.g. `gas_fees.infer`

`sql`

The Spice.ai SQL query for fetching inferencing data.

E.g. `SELECT number as "ts", CAST(base_fee_per_gas / 1000000000.0 AS DOUBLE) as "y", CAST(transaction_count AS DOUBLE) as "y2" from eth.recent_blocks WHERE base_fee_per_gas IS NOT NULL ORDER BY ts DESC LIMIT 35`

`lookback_size`

The lookback size/window.

`forecast_size`

The forecast size/window.

### Example definition
