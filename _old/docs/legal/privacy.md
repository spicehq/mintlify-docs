For purposes of this Agreement, “Site” refers to our website, blogs, social media accounts, or apps in which Company’s service can be accessed in** which users can view the website and subscribe to and use our software, products, and/or services (each a “**Service**,” and collectively the “**Services**”).

Your privacy is important to us. So, please take the time to carefully read this Privacy Policy. If you have any questions on how we collect, use, protect, or otherwise handle your Personal Information (as further described below), please contact us.

Unless otherwise defined in this Privacy Policy, terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meaning as in our Terms of Service. By using the Services, you consent to our collection, storage, use and disclosure of your Personal Information under the terms set forth herein.

### I. INFORMATION WE COLLECT

We collect “**Non-Personal Information**” and “**Personal Information**.” Non-Personal Information includes information that cannot be used to personally identify you, such as anonymous usage data, general demographic information we may collect, referring/exit pages and URLs, platform types, preferences you submit, and preferences that are generated based on the data you submit and number of clicks. Personal Information includes your email, phone number, address, and any other information you submit to us through the Site. We collect information related to you for the purpose of carrying out the Services. This information includes but is not limited to: name, address, email address, telephone number, bank account number, credit or debit card number, or other financial information.

We collect “**Commercial Information**” and “**Internet or other electronic network activity information**” such as records of personal property, products or services purchased, obtained, or considered, or other purchasing or consuming histories, or tendencies, browsing history, search history, or information regarding a consumer’s interaction with an Internet website, application, or advertisement.

1. _Information collected via Technology_. In an effort to improve the quality of the Services, we track information provided to us by your browser or by our software application when you view or use the Services, such as the website you came from (known as the “referring URL”), the type of browser you use, the device from which you connected to the Services, the time and date of access, and other information that does not personally identify you. We track this information using cookies, or small text files which include an anonymous unique identifier. Cookies are sent to a user’s browser from our servers and are stored on the user’s computer hard drive. Sending a cookie to a user’s browser enables us to collect Non-Personal information about that user and keep a record of the user’s preferences when utilizing our Services, both on an individual and aggregate basis. Company may use both persistent and session cookies; persistent cookies remain on your computer after you close your session and until you delete them, while session cookies expire when you close your browser.
2. _Information you provide us by registering for an account_. In addition to the information provided automatically by your browser when you visit the Site, to become a customer to the Service, you will need to create a personal profile. Creating a profile and registering with the Service may require you to provide your name, phone number, email address, and other personal information and creating a username and a password. By registering, you are authorizing us to collect, store, and use your email address in accordance with this Privacy Policy. \\

### II. HOW WE USE AND SHARE INFORMATION
