* Manual function management.
  * Manual triggers, pause/restart of execution, etc.
* Local Development and Debugging experience.
* Rewind/replay/backfill support v1 - idempotent
* Automatically hydrated input
* Integrated secret store
* Cron triggers
* Rewind/replay/backfill support v2 - versioning/snapshotting
* Streaming logs
* Node.js runtime
* Rust runtime
